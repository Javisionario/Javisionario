# Hi there, I'm Javi 👋
![](banner.png)

Environmental and transport engineer focused on mobility, road safety, and data-driven territorial planning.

I have advanced skills in GIS and spatial analysis, which I use to understand territorial dynamics, evaluate the impacts of mobility projects, and support data-driven decision-making. I am particularly interested in projects that enhance sustainability, safety, and resilience while making everyday travel simpler and more humane.

In this profile you can find tools, scripts and examples related to GIS, mobility analysis, and data-driven planning — from QGIS workflows to Python experiments.
